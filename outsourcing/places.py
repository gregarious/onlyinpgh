    Attempts to resolve a raw text string into a Place or Location using

    First, the Resolve API is queried using various mutations of the
    fields in the input text. 

    If none of these attempts are successful, the Google Geocoding API 
    is used to at least get a physical location. In addition, some simple
    parsing of the text will be used to guess at a potential name for the
    place. If no such place name can be discerned, the fallback_place_name
    argument will be used as a last result.

    If Location object is provided as seed_location Location, the completed
    fields from it are used as hints to help resolving. These hints are more
    forgiving than those used in the Resolve API. Note that the Location's 
    address field will have no bearing on the results.

    Will never fail -- worst case behavior returns a simple Place object with
    the fallback place name and no location.
